Hello, I'm Gaurav Mathur. I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. This platform serves as a space where I share insights on programming and software systems. Occasionally, I'll delve into other topics that pique my interest.

The name `Acchi Life` is inspired by the Hindi word `Acchi`, meaning `good`. It represents the positive experiences that shape my writings and what I enjoy talking about.
