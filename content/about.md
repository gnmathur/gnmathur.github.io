Hello, I'm Gaurav Mathur. I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. This platform serves as a space where I share insights on programming and software systems. Occasionally, I'll delve into other topics that pique my interest.

On the name "Acchi Life": In Hindi, "Acchi" means "Good". It's a nod to the blessings I've received in life, a sentiment I hope resonates in my writings ðŸ™‚
